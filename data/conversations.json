      "content": "Okay, let's see. The user asked, \"Whats my plan tmrw?\" and I initially thought there was an event for tomorrow, but they pointed out that the date might have passed. Then I called the list_calendar_events tool and got the response showing events from January 14th to January 21st. \n\nLooking at the events, the first one is \"Apply for bourse perspective!\" on January 14th, which is actually yesterday. The next event is \"Sleep\" starting on the 15th, which is tomorrow. Wait, the user is asking about tomorrow's plan, so the \"Sleep\" event starting on the 15th is tomorrow. But the user might be confused because the initial response mentioned the 14th. \n\nI need to clarify that the event on the 14th was yesterday, and tomorrow's event is the \"Sleep\" one. Also, there are other events scheduled for the 16th and beyond. The user might need to know that the \"Apply for bourse\" event is in the past, and their tomorrow's plan is to sleep. But maybe they have more events? Let me check the list again.\n\nWait, the events listed include multiple \"Sleep\" entries, but the user might be focusing on their main activities. The key is to highlight that the \"Apply for bourse\" is done, and tomorrow's main event is sleep. However, the user might have more plans, so I should mention that there are other events starting from the 16th. But since they asked specifically about tomorrow, I should focus on the 15th. \n\nI should also apologize for the earlier confusion and make sure to present the information clearly. Maybe the user is concerned about missing something, so confirming the dates and offering further help is important. Let me structure the response to address their confusion, clarify the dates, and ask if they need more details.\nOh no! I see where I messed up. Let me correct that:\n\nTomorrow (January 15th) actually looks like this:\n- Your main event is \"Sleep\" from 10 PM to midnight\n- The \"Apply for bourse perspective!\" event was yesterday (1/14)\n\nBut wait - I just noticed something interesting! You've got a big work day coming up on the 16th with \"CMO - Work\" from 8 AM to 5 PM. Want to talk about how you're preparing for that? Or is there something else you're curious about?",
